          <em>Connect on a deeper level to find your true soulmate with matching based on horoscope compatibility.</em>

          <p> This project was built with a single-page web application by using a React/Redux UI & react-router and accomplished RESTful routing with a Rails API which manages the data persistence. I demonstrated use of asynchronous Redux actions with Redux Thunk to send & receive data from a server, & to respond to & modify state change.</p>
